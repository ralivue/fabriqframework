NOTES (READ CAREFULLY FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON UPDATING):
 - When updating between versions, if your version is more than 2 minor versions different (the
   minor version is the first number after the first decimal point starting from the left),
   you should download updates and apply them in order for all versions between the version you
   are currently using and the latest release. Be sure to read the UPDATE.txt file for each
   release as each release may contain different instructions based on updates provided.
   
 - When referencing mapping functions, the PathMap class should be referenced and
   not the BaseMapping class. The PathMap class extends the BaseMapping class and
   therefore has inherits all of the BaseMapping class' functionality.
   
 - With the release of version 1.3, helper files have been deprecated. You should move any functions
   inside of helper files to their respective controllers. If the functions are for use only in
   the controller, they should be marked as private.
   
 - Please note that starting with the release of version 1.0, all odd numbered minor versions
   (the minor version is the first number after the decimal point starting from the left) are
   development versions (example: version 1.1 is a development version) and all even numbered minor
   versions are stable releases (example: versions 1.0 and 1.2 are stable versions). If you are not
   sure whether or not to use a development version, wait for the stable release. Stable releases generally
   come within a week or two of development version but may take longer in cases where major updates
   are introduced to the framework.
