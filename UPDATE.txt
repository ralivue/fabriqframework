NOTES (READ CAREFULLY FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON UPDATING):
 - When referencing mapping functions, the PathMap class should be referenced and
   not the BaseMapping class. The PathMap class extends the BaseMapping class and
   therefore has inherits all of the BaseMapping class' functionality.

 - Updates can only be made from version 3.0. If your installed version of Fabriq
   is older than that, please download the 3.0 tag and update to that first. After updating
   to version 3.0, you can then update to the latest version.
