NOTES (READ CAREFULLY FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON UPDATING):
 - In version 0.8, the fabriq.js class was removed from /public/javascripts to /core for
   easier upgrading and to keep the core files in the same location
   
 - In version 0.8, the path mapping functionality was moved from /core/Fabriq.class.php to
   the new /core/BaseMapping.class.php file. The /core/BaseMapping.class.php file
   should not be edited. For customizations to mapping, the /app/PathMap.class.php
   file extends the /core/BaseMapping.class.php file and has been provided to enable
   developers to define custom path mapping rules. Functionality that has been moved
   from /core/Fabriq.class.php to /core/BaseMapping.class.php is marked in the
   documentation at http://docs.fabriqframework.com/ as deprecated. NOTE: functions
   from /core/Fabriq.class.php that were moved to /core/BaseMapping.class.php will
   be REMOVED in version 0.12 of Fabriq. Please update any references to those functions
   to use the new functions in /app/PathMap.class.php.
   
 - When referencing mapping functions, the PathMap class should be referenced and
   not the BaseMapping class. The PathMap class extends the BaseMapping class and
   therefore has inherits all of the BaseMapping class' functionality.
   
 - The /core/Controller.class.php file has been added to extend the object-oriented
   nature of the Framework to the controller structure. This move will also help
   facilitate future expansion plans of the framework.
   
 - The /core/Messaging.class.php file has been added to create an object-oriented way
   of adding messages to your pages. The core file manages errors, successes, warnings,
   and general messages. To add more functionality to the messaging system, extend the
   Messaging class and include the class in your /app/controllers/application.controller.php
   file. Then, in your code, reference the class that you created as a singleton class
   (ex: MyMessaging::message('Test error message', 'new variable added in extended class');)
